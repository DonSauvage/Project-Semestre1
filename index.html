            <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
            <p>
                The first Dungeons & Dragons game was played back when Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson chose to personalize
                the massive battles of their fantasy wargames with the exploits of individual heroes. This inspiration
                became the first fantasy roleplaying game, in which players are characters in an ongoing fantasy story.
                This new kind of game has become immensely popular over the years, and D&D has grown to include many new
                ways to vividly experience worlds of heroic fantasy.<br>

                The core of D&D is storytelling. You and your friends tell a story together, guiding your heroes through
                quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, courtly intrigue, and much more. You can
                also explore the world of Dungeons & Dragons through any of the novels written by its fantasy authors,
                as well as engaging board games and immersive video games. All of these stories are part of D&D.
            </p>
            <h2> Why should you play D&D? </h2>
            <p>Have you ever seen the Lord of the rings / The Hobbit movies or read the books? Have you ever played
                Skyrim or Oblivion back in the days? If you have you're in the right place my friend.<br>
                The movies, books and games I just mentioned were limited by mood, budget, and the political, historical
                & fictional rules and agendas of the author (J.R.R. Talkien), the film studio (New Line Cinema) and the
                game developers (Bethesda Game Studios, Iron Galaxy).<br>
                In this game -nay- this <strong>world</strong>, however, the only limit is your <strong>own</strong>
                imagination.<br></p>


                <p><strong>You can do and be whatever, whoever, whenever forever! </strong><br></p>

            <p>
                You can travel and explore places and lore. <br> You can fight to save or fuck the tavern's whore.<br>
                You can steal or punish thieves, you can impersonate or flirt or kill Keanu Reeves.<br>
                You can be a Dwarf, Human, Orc, Goliath, Elf. <br>
                You can be a Warrior, Munk, Druid, Rogue, a Wizzard.<br>
                You can slay the dragon and keep the loot all for yourself,<br> 
                or make friends with that monstrous lizzard.<br>
                This and a whole lot more awaits in the beyond. So what are you waiting for?
